# Games

This folder contains small game prototypes used for demos and experimentation.

Files:
- `item-swap-game.tsx` — a canvas-based item-collection / delivery prototype. Item Finder Game
A side-scrolling adventure game prototype where the player finds the required items to complete the stage. This could also work for web friendly puzzle games or something more complex such as an adventure style looting game.


- Other prototypes may include platformers, puzzles, and interactive demos.
