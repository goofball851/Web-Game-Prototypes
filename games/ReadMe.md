# Games

This folder contains small game prototypes used for demos and experimentation.


- `Item Swap game` — A canvas-based item-collection / delivery prototype. Item Finder Game
A side-scrolling adventure game prototype where the player finds the required items to complete the stage. This could also work for web friendly puzzle games or something more complex such as an adventure style looting game.

- `Silent Shadows game` — A minimalist indie stealth game prototype inspired by *CounterSpy* and mid-century **Saul Bass–style** poster design.  
The game emphasizes silhouettes, restraint, and intentional movement — where **standing still can be safer than moving**.




- Other prototypes may include platformers, puzzles, and interactive demos.
