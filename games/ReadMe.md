# Games

This folder contains small game prototypes used for demos and experimentation.

Files:
- `item-swap-game.tsx` — a canvas-based item-collection / delivery prototype.
- Other prototypes may include platformers, puzzles, and interactive demos.

Notes:
- Add a short README for each new game directory describing controls, dependencies, and how to run it.
- Git doesn't track empty folders. If you need the folder present with no files yet, add a `.gitkeep` file.
